== Development Cycle
====================
The development cycle begins with ‘dev-1’.The ‘dev-1’ branch represents new additions that have yet to be tested and may be highly unstable. When the branch has been developed enough and satisfies basic stability requirements it can be merged into ‘dev-2’. In ‘dev-2’ the additions are further refined and stabilized. When ‘dev-2’ has been sufficiently tested it can be pushed into the master production branch. The movement from ‘dev-2’ to master is forced. It will overwrite the source in master.
